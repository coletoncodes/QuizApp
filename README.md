# Quiz App - Flutter Project

A simple quiz application built using Flutter. This app allows users to take a quiz by answering true or false questions and keeps track of their progress with visual feedback. The app demonstrates various features of Flutter, such as state management, reusable components, and alert dialogs. This project is part of my Flutter portfolio and showcases my ability to build cross-platform mobile applications.

## üöÄ Features

- True/False quiz functionality with multiple questions.
- Keeps track of correct and incorrect answers using icons.
- Alerts the user when they finish the quiz and resets the game.
- Clean, simple UI built with Flutter's widgets.
- Cross-platform support for iOS and Android devices.
